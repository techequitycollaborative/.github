## About TechEquity

TechEquity was founded in 2016 to answer a simple but ambitious question: what would it take for the growth of the tech industry to benefit everyone? We raise public consciousness about economic equity issues resulting from the tech industry’s products and practices and advocate for change that ensures tech’s evolution benefits everyone.
